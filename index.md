# Charles Giessen's Portfolio 


## Projects

### Vulkan Game Engine
 * Uses the new Vulkan graphics API for rendering
 * Features:
     * Asynchronous loading & preparation of data into GPU 
     ![Lanscape Example](/images/Siggraph_lanscape2.jpg)
     
     * Infinite terrain with LOD
     ![Terrain LOD](/images/siggraph_terrain_lod.jpg)
     
     * Physically Based Rendering
     ![PBR](/images/PBR_materials.jpg)

 * Written in C++17
 * Libraries used: GLFW, Dear ImGui, Bullet Physics, glm, nlohman json, stb_image.h, FastNoiseSIMD, VulkanMemoryAllocator


### Procedural Terrain Generator
 * Create infinite terrain 
 * Features a node based visual graph editor to create unique terrain algorithms
 * Implemented inside my Vulkan Game Engine
 * Written in C++17
